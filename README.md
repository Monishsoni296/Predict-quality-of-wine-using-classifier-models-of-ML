Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier | Random Forest Classifier | Support Vector Classifier
Using different classifier models (Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVC),we analyze the effects of ten features, e.g.,alcohol and pH, on the quality scores of wines. After that we used cross validation evaluation technique to optimize the model performance.
